##  üìñ Overview

This is an **HTML** & **CSS-only** challenge, ideal for those just starting out in frontend development or anyone looking for a small project to experiment with. The objective of this challenge is to build a preview card component, aiming to replicate the provided design as closely as possible.

The project is built using SCSS for styling, which allows for a more organized and maintainable approach to the CSS code. Various tools and techniques can be employed during the process, providing an opportunity to practice and explore different aspects of frontend development.

**Key Features:**
-  The layout is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes and devices.
-  Interactive elements, such as buttons or links, include hover states, adding a layer of interactivity to the design.

This challenge offers a great opportunity to practice CSS fundamentals, work with responsive design, and implement **SCSS** for better code structure and maintainability.

###  üî¨ What I learned

Throughout this challenge, I had the opportunity to learn several valuable techniques that enhanced my frontend skills. One of the key things I learned was how to create responsive text using the `clamp()` function in CSS. This function allowed me to set dynamic font sizes that adjust smoothly across different screen sizes, giving me better control over typography and ensuring the text remains readable and visually appealing on all devices.

I also had the chance to work with **local fonts** for the first time, which was a departure from my usual practice of using Google Fonts. By incorporating a **.ttf** file locally, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manage custom fonts and integrate them into a project using `@font-face`, which added a personal touch to the design.

Additionally, I experimented with hover **effects on images**, which was a technique I hadn't used much before. By adding these hover states, I was able to create more interactive and engaging visuals, making the user experience more dynamic.

This challenge was a great opportunity to broaden my knowledge of CSS, typography, and interactivity, and I'm excited to continue exploring these concepts in future projects.
